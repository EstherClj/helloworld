# helloworld
my first coding on GitHub
Hi people, I am Esther, learning to use GitHub to code. Still okay at the moment, learnt the following:
Creating a repository (project space)
Creating a branch (master branch from which branches for different versions of the working code)
Making and committing changes (coming up!)
